WHAT TO SHARE WITH CHATGPT - QUICK REFERENCE
================================================================================

OPTION 1: QUICK OVERVIEW (Recommended Start)
---------------------------------------------
Share: ONE_PAGE_SUMMARY.md

Say: "I built a multiscale clustering detector for cosmic structure. Here's 
      a one-page summary. Help me decide which research direction to pursue."

ChatGPT gets: Complete picture in 60 seconds


OPTION 2: COMPLETE CONTEXT (For Strategic Discussion)
-----------------------------------------------------
Share: EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md

Say: "Read this executive summary of a project I completed with Claude. 
      Started looking for Einstein tiles in cosmic structure, ended up 
      creating something much more general. Need help picking next steps."

ChatGPT gets: Full journey, all technical details, all 10 research directions


OPTION 3: DEEP DIVE (If ChatGPT Wants More)
-------------------------------------------
Share in order:
1. EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md
2. TEST_RESULTS_AND_NEW_DIRECTIONS.md
3. PRODUCTION_READY_COMMANDS.md

ChatGPT gets: Everything needed for detailed planning


================================================================================
SPECIFIC USE CASES:
================================================================================

IF YOU WANT: Strategic career advice
SHARE: EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md
ASK: "Which research direction makes most sense for [your situation]?"

IF YOU WANT: Help writing a paper
SHARE: EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md + TEST_RESULTS_AND_NEW_DIRECTIONS.md
ASK: "Help me outline a paper on [chosen direction]"

IF YOU WANT: Technical collaboration ideas
SHARE: PRODUCTION_READY_COMMANDS.md
ASK: "What fields could benefit from this tool?"

IF YOU WANT: Understanding the validation journey
SHARE: RIGOROUS_TEST_RESULTS.md + FINAL_DIAGNOSIS.md
ASK: "Explain why the validation approach changed"

================================================================================
QUESTIONS CHATGPT CAN ANSWER WITH THESE DOCS:
================================================================================

Strategic:
✓ Which research direction should I pursue?
✓ What's the publication strategy?
✓ How to transition from cosmology to other fields?
✓ What collaborators do I need?

Technical:
✓ How does the covariance-aware χ² work?
✓ Why did validation fail initially?
✓ What's the difference from traditional tests?
✓ How to adapt the method to new domains?

Practical:
✓ What's the timeline for each direction?
✓ Which journals to target?
✓ How to write the methods section?
✓ What data do I need?

================================================================================
WHAT NOT TO SHARE (unless specifically asked):
================================================================================

× Old failed versions (voronoi_deep_dive.py, test_voronoi_hypotheses.py)
× Intermediate diagnostic files
× Code with bugs (anything not "production" in name)

Only share test_multiscale_production.py if ChatGPT asks for implementation

================================================================================
EXAMPLE CONVERSATION STARTER:
================================================================================

"Hey ChatGPT, I've been working on a cosmology project with Claude. Started 
trying to detect Einstein tile patterns in galaxy distributions, but ended up 
building something more general - a validated framework for detecting clustering 
in sparse 3D point clouds.

The tool is production-ready and validated. My advisor identified 10 potential 
research directions ranging from cosmology to seismology to neuroscience.

I'm attaching the executive summary. Can you help me think through:
1. Which direction has the best risk/reward for a [timeline] project?
2. What specific research question should I ask?
3. How should I pitch this to collaborators/advisors?

[Paste EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md]"

================================================================================
KEY POINTS TO EMPHASIZE:
================================================================================

1. Tool is VALIDATED (passed controls, not just "seems to work")
2. Cross-disciplinary applications (not just cosmology)
3. Validation journey is itself publishable
4. Production-ready code exists
5. Need to pick one direction and execute
